# Overview
The VoD System is a powerful clip management platform designed to streamline how you handle your video content. Whether you're a content creator, streamer, or educator, VoD System lets you:

- Upload clips effortlessly and securely.
- Edit and trim videos with intuitive controls.
- Compress files to specific file sizes.
- Organize your clips for quick access and sharing.

This VoD system began as a small project back in my 5th year of secondary school, during lockdown. I wanted a quick way to send game clips to Discord, but the 8MB file size limit made it frustrating to manually tweak bitrates for every clip. To solve that, I wrote a simple Python script to automate the process. What started as a quick fix has since evolved into a full-fledged system â€” now built with a Spring Boot backend and a modern React/Vite frontend.

## Requirements
- Docker & Docker Compose
- JDK 21+
- Node.js 16+
## Steps
1. Spin up docker container with `docker compose up`
2. Run `./mvnw clean package` to build the jar
3. Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to run the backend section
4. Run `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` to build and run the frontend
5. Endpoints should be available at 8080 (backend) and 5173 (frontend)
